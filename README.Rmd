# sfct

The goal of sfct is to provide constrained triangulations of simple features. 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sf)
nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))
nc_triangles <- ct_triangulate(nc)
plot(nc_triangles)
```
