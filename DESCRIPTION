Title: Constrained Triangulation for Simple Features
Version: 0.0.6
Authors@R: person("Michael D.","Sumner", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "mdsumner@gmail.com")
Description: Build a constrained 'Delaunay' triangulation from simple features
    objects, applying constraints based on input line segments, and triangle
    properties including maximum area, minimum internal angle. The triangulation code
    in 'RTriangle' uses the method of Cheng, Dey and Shewchuk (2012, ISBN:9781584887300). 
    For a low-dependency alternative with low-quality path-based constrained 
    triangulation see <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=decido>.
